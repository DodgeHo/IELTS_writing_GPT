To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

### Writing for Evaluation:
In my opinion, governments should allocate more resources to [**infrastructure development**] in the form of railways rather than focusing solely on roads. Railways offer significant advantages in terms of [**sustainable transportation**], as they produce fewer emissions and reduce traffic congestion compared to road systems. This is particularly important in addressing global environmental challenges, such as climate change.

Moreover, railways can enhance [**economic efficiency**] by providing faster and more reliable transportation for both passengers and goods. For example, high-speed rail networks in countries like Japan and France have proven to be highly effective in reducing travel time and boosting regional economic growth. In contrast, road transportation often leads to higher maintenance costs and traffic-related delays.

However, it is important to recognize that both railways and roads are essential components of a modern transportation system. Governments should carefully manage [**public expenditure**] to balance investments in both sectors. For instance, in densely populated urban areas, railways may be more suitable, while roads remain crucial for rural connectivity.

In conclusion, while I agree that railways should be prioritized due to their lower [**environmental impact**] and economic benefits, a balanced approach to infrastructure development is necessary for a comprehensive and efficient transportation system.
