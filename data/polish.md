### 修改后的完整文章

In my opinion, governments should prioritize investing in railway infrastructure over road systems to enhance sustainable transportation and economic efficiency. Railways offer significant advantages in terms of sustainable transportation, as they produce fewer emissions and reduce traffic congestion compared to road systems. Moreover, railways can enhance economic efficiency by providing faster and more reliable transportation for both passengers and goods. For example, high-speed rail networks in countries like Japan and France have proven to be highly effective in reducing travel time and boosting regional economic growth.

In contrast, road transportation often leads to higher maintenance costs and traffic delays. According to a study by the International Energy Agency (IEA), road transportation accounts for approximately 72% of global transport emissions, while railways contribute only 7%. This stark difference highlights the environmental benefits of prioritizing railways. Additionally, the maintenance costs for roads are significantly higher due to frequent repairs and the need for continuous upgrades to accommodate increasing traffic volumes.

However, it is important to recognize that both railways and roads are essential components of a modern transportation system. While railways are more suitable for long-distance and high-volume transportation, roads play a crucial role in connecting rural areas and providing last-mile connectivity. Therefore, governments should adopt a balanced approach to investment, ensuring that both sectors receive adequate funding based on their specific needs and contexts. For instance, in urban areas with high population density, prioritizing railways can alleviate traffic congestion and reduce emissions, whereas in rural areas, investing in roads may be more appropriate to improve accessibility and support local economies.

In conclusion, while railways should be the primary focus of government investment due to their environmental and economic benefits, a balanced approach that considers the unique requirements of both railways and roads is essential for building a comprehensive and efficient transportation system.
